# Hello there!

Im a 18 year old girl from Norway who codes as a part of school as well as for fun.

I prefer HTML and CSS, love designing websites and trying new things.

At the moment my favoritt project i have done is "nyPortfolio-Kopi" (i really need to give a better name to it ;D), this is because it shows the amount of progress i have made. It houses all my prodjects as well (or it will, when i fix it) and i just love that i can make it my own.

Would love any feebback you have. 

If you need anything just reach out at koderatidesign@gmail.com 

Can't promise i will answer you fast, but i will do my best :)

Lots of love B <3
